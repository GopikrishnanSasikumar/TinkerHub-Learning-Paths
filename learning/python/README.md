## Write better python code

Learn how to write better python code 

- [fluent python](https://www.amazon.in/Fluent-Python-Luciano-Ramalho/dp/1491946008) is a very good resource
- [Hitchhiker's guide to python](https://docs.python-guide.org/) 

## Learn to build web apps using python

Learn how to build web apps using python and a web app framework like,

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) : As it says web framework for perfectionists
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) : High performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production web app framework

All of the above frameworks have very good documentations and tutorials to learn


## Do projects

There are 2 ways to do projects in python !

### Solve with python 
1. Find a real world problem you are facing that can be automated using python
2. There are tons of tons of packages in python to solve your issue.
3. Google `package for <insert your problem domain> python` and see if one is available
4. Use the package to build solution for your problem

### Contribute to opensource projects

1. You can search github for good python projects
2. Click issues of the github project you find interesting to contribute
3. Go through the issues and find an issue you can code
4. Write code for fixing that issue and put a pull request!

Happy learning :)
